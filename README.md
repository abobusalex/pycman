# pycman
Worst Pacman implementation. Ever. PyGame

## Why

I wanted to take a programming challenge so Pacman is what I've got. Whole game was made in 1 night within any knowing of PyGame. It has
1. 2 sounds 
1. Some enemies
1. Bugs
1. Score

It hasn't
1. Main menu
2. Clear code
3. Other important stuff. Who cares 

## Install 
```
pip intall pygame
py pycman.py
```
